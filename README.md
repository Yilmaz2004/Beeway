# Beeway
Project that I make during my internship at ict@school/ict@work

We had already started making this project in `Javascript/Jquery` with `ajax` and an api made in `PHP` (see repository 'beeway')
but we realized it would take much less code and it would be easier and more secure to make it with Embedded PHP in the HTML.

It will be a kind of scheduling software for schools on a website.

Wil be hosted on http://beeway.nl/

## Beeway code explain</h2>
- `HTML, CSS` and `javascript` for the frond end
- Embedded `PHP` for back end and communicating with database
- `MySQL` Database
